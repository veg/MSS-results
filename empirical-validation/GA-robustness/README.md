Here I explore how the partition selected by the GA changes with the input training data. Files in this folder are the GA outputs. Each output is derived from a unique set of 100 randomly selected *Enterobacteria* alignments.

## Parameters:

- **alignments per training dataset:** 100 (randomly selected for each dataset)
- **training datasets:** 10
- **information criterion:** BIC
- **codon partitioning scheme:** by amino acid
